## Socialbook

Welcome to my first 'serious' app, which is a social networking service that resembles 'Facebook' to some extent.
Although there's still plenty of work to be done on it, unfortunately, I haven't had much time recently to improve
its appearance and functionality. Despite that, the app has all the necessary functionalities to work, such as:

- creating an account and logging in to it
- adding posts on the wall
- dropping comments under posts
- hitting a 'like' button and unliking it
- adding and removing friends from a list of all users
- changing account's personal data
- playing a JavaScript very simple game

Further development of this app is to be continued...

- I added this project here with only one main commit and push as I was still learning and not very familiar with GitHub at the time.
